                { title: 'Java', id: 2, details: "I can't say I know a lot of Java, but it was the language I used when I was learning and using object oriented concepts for the first time."},
                { title: 'HTML & CSS', id: 3, details: "Foundation of every web site. When I first learned basics of HTML and CSS in highschool, I couldn't believe that web world was that \"simple\". I still can't believe how much stuff you can build using only those two."},
                { title: 'Bootstrap', id: 4, details: "Talking about CSS, Bootstrap is a very easy and powerful CSS component framework I have used. Also, I am familiar with utility frameworks such as Tailwind, but didn't use it as much."},
                { title: 'JavaScript', id: 5, details: "I rembember several years ago I wondered what was the difference beetween Java and JavaScript. Luckily, today I know that JavaScript is a script language and one skill you can't live without if you are working in web development. I always stick to it, but I would love to learn TypeScript also."},
                { title: 'Vue.js', id: 6, details: "Really great front end framework which I enjoyed using while making a single page web application."},
                { title: 'Node.js', id: 7, details: "My first steps in the world of back end development. I haven't really used it that much, only for laboratory excercises at university."},
                { title: 'PostgreSQL', id: 8, details: "Very simple tool for managing databases. I don't have that much experience in it, but I used it in some occasions."},
                { title: 'Visual Studio Code', id: 9, details: "Nothing much to say here. For me, and I believe for many developers out there, definetly an IDE of choice. Plugins make your coding experience much more enjoyable."},
                { title: 'Git', id: 10, details: "Very important system in the world of software developing. One year ago I thought terms \"push\" and \"pull\" very only used in gym and fitness scenarios, and that you have to \"commit\" when you are in a relationship... Little did I know, I would use those terms very frequently in a very different environment."}
