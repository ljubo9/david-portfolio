        Hi, my name is David! 
        <br>I am a 3rd year student at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (also known as FER) in Zagreb.
        <br>Since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated with computers and how they work. Today, when I have some very little idea what is happening behind the curtain, I am looking to start and build my career as a software developer. Although, as far as I'm concerned, any job/internship in fields that include computing would suit me well.
        <br>Outside of my schooling and business aspirations, I am really into sports and fitness. Perfect way for me to disconnect and take a break is by watching and playing sports, or having a good workout.
